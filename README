I posted a question on 

http://enthuware.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2450

and they answered me, so I decided to create an example of the question.

This is the example where another bean calls a business method in another stateless session bean.
Then this business method calls an asynchronous method in the same object.
This is the question exactly, the code will execute synchronously because the async call will not be managed by the container, it's a simple direct method call.

To install in Eclipse, just run

mvn eclipse:eclipse 

Then import the project directory to your eclipse workspace.

To run on glassfish embedded server, just run

mvn clean package install

You can also run the unit tests on Eclipse, the result is the same.
